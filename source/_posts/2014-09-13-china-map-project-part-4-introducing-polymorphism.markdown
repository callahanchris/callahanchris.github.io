### MOVE TO NEXT POST??
Fun fact: China has 22 provinces (e.g. Shaanxi, Guangdong), 5 autonomous regions (e.g. Tibet, Inner Mongolia), 4 municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Tianjin), and 2 special administrative regions (SARs) (Hong Kong and Macau).

I considered breaking up the `Region` model into several smaller models (i.e. `Province`, `AutonomousRegion`, etc.), I wanted the data output from the JSON API to all be standardized and accessible from one endpoint, so I decided not to go too far down this polymorphic path.
