Hi, I'm Chris. I'm a Software Engineer at The New York Times working on audio, video, and other web projects. I'm interested in learning about front end web technologies and computer science topics. Outside of coding, I like to practice my Chinese (你好，我叫石开😊), drink tea, and play with my cat Newton.
