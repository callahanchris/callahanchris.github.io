<div class="entry-content"><p>I was struck by this realization recently when going through Michael Hartl&rsquo;s <a href="http://railstutorial.org"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em></a>. This was my first exposure to Rails; however, I had learned a bit of Ruby before, and as such was under the impression that I knew a thing or two about coding.</p>

<p>Overall, the tutorial was difficult and intense, but at the end I felt very accomplished for having made it all the way through. I learned a ton about Rails, test-driven development (TDD), ERb, and Ruby. Of critical importance to this was my brother, <a href="http://andrewcallahan.github.io">Andrew Callahan</a>, who was on hand to help me with my questions and problems and to offer his insights on programming.</p>

<p>I learned some important lessons while undertaking this tutorial that I hope can help me in my transition from non-programmer to programmer.</p>

<h3>1. Environment is Essential</h3>

<p>Prior to taking on the Hartl Rails Tutorial, most of the programs I had written were in Ruby alone. In order to get these programs to run, all I needed was a text editor, a terminal, and a Ruby. This setup was relatively simple to get up and running:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ruby file.rb</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Rails is a bit more complex. First, I installed the Rails gem, then when building the app I had to specify which gems I needed to use to get all aspects of the app up and running. Throughout this process, a number of dependencies were introduced and I had to do a bit of wrangling with version numbers to get everything working properly. I also installed the Ruby Version Manager (RVM) and got more familiar with using git, GitHub, and Heroku.</p>

<p>I got burned by not paying close attention to my environment when going through the Hartl tutorial. I started off using the Rails 4.0 version of the tutorial, and I used Rails 4.1 &mdash; the latest version at the time &mdash; when making my first example app. I then went back and saw that the Flatiron School <a href="http://prework.flatironschool.com">prework site</a> recommended going through the Rails 3.2 edition of the tutorial. I went back, installed Rails 3.2 and Ruby 1.9.3, and then made it through the first couple chapters of the tutorial without much issue.</p>

<p>The next day I was surprised to find that railstutorial.org had undergone a redesign, and the Rails 3.2 version of the book had gone behind a paywall. The Rails 4.0 version was still available for free &mdash; and what an incredible free resource it is! &mdash; so I tried to push forward by applying the instructions in the Rails 4.0 version to my Rails 3.2 app. This was a mistake. Eventually, I cut my losses and restarted the tutorial using Rails 4.0.</p>

<p>(As a side note, after writing the first draft of this blog post I made the same mistake as described above, but in reverse, on a <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> Rails tutorial. I ended up having to restart the tutorial using a different version of Rails. I really need to pay better attention to accurately setting up my dev environment!)</p>

<p>Whereas before I considered programming to simply be the act of writing code, after making a sample app in Rails I realized that getting the proper environment set up can often be half the battle. Understanding the tools that make up the technology stack is incredibly important and is something I want to learn more about going forward.</p>

<h3>2. Read the Error Messages</h3>

<p>Another misconception I had was that code should generally work, and when it doesn&rsquo;t it should be debugged. This notion was turned completely on its head thanks to TDD, where code first fails and subsequently is made to work.</p>

<p>Even though I was following the code of the tutorial closely, some unexpected errors (in addition to the expected ones) inevitably popped up. Until Andrew pointed this out to me, I didn&rsquo;t realize that I had unconsciously just been glazing over the error messages showing up in the terminal. Prior to this, my &ldquo;process&rdquo; was essentially:</p>

<ul>
<li>See an error message surface.</li>
<li>Ignore its contents.</li>
<li>Immediately return to the text editor.</li>
<li>Guess what caused the error.</li>
<li>Try to fix what I guessed to be the problematic code.</li>
</ul>


<p>The error messages are there to help you; read them. This lesson seems really basic, but it is a great thing that I learned.</p>

<h3>3. Power Through</h3>

<p>Making a functioning Twitter-like app in Rails was hard. But that&rsquo;s OK &mdash; I have only done it one time, and had never done anything like it before going through Hartl&rsquo;s tutorial. I expected to be able to &ldquo;just get things&rdquo; before going in (remember, I &ldquo;knew&rdquo; about coding), and found that it was nowhere near that simple. After completing the tutorial, I realize that there are more areas that I don&rsquo;t understand than those I do. That&rsquo;s also OK &mdash; I am going to be learning all about Rails when I start at the <a href="http://flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a> next month.</p>

<p>I tend to be meticulous and work slowly if I am trying to fully grasp the subject matter at hand. I could have easily spent twice as much time on the Rails tutorial than I did, but it&rsquo;s probably a good thing that I didn&rsquo;t. Instead of dwelling on everything I didn&rsquo;t understand, I powered through and practiced &ldquo;getting used to&rdquo; the things I didn&rsquo;t understand. Rather than obsessively going down each rabbit hole, I tried to keep an eye on the big picture and take things in stride.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I am excited to have begun learning how to program Rails applications and to be making progress on my path to becoming a professional web developer. Though I feel accomplished about completing the Hartl <em>Rails Tutorial</em>, working my way through it really made me realize how little I know and how much learning I have ahead of me. I am glad to have had a taste of the Rails development process and gleaned the lessons above.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll say it again: I don&rsquo;t know how to program. It&rsquo;s the truth. Now that I&rsquo;ve put that out there, the only way to go is up.</p>
